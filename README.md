# Minkowski_islands
This project is to draw three different types of Minkowski islands with the use of recursion in python. All the minkowski islands in this projects are in square but you can change according to the shapes you want: just need to do very simple math calculation and change perimeter in this file

The use of each line is based on Koch curve and Minkowski sausage. 

This project is simply for designing something beautiful and fun!!! I plan to insert it into later projects if I have opportunity

Wish to be helpful for you and it is a good way to review recursion BTW
